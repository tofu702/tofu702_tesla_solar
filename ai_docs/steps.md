# Step 1: Write a more advanced grapher
Read the file in `server/static/day_data.html` and the API docs in `openapi.json`. Create a new `day_data_unified.html` in `server/static` that:
* Unifies both existing graphs in `day_data.html` in to a single graph
* Graphs the solar data (in kwh) using a separate y-axis from the day length (in hours)
* Has check boxes for enabling or disabling the lines.
